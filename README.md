- The second Project of Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

- A multi-section landing page, a real-world scenario of manipulating the DOM and a opportunity for me to test my skills to fully combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. 

- The page is based on the starter project offered by Udacity and aimed to meet all the requirements in the project rubric.

- The five "Suggested" Items are included in the Project (not quite sure if they are all correctly done though...), they are:

    - Add a scroll to top button
    - Update/change the design/content
    - Make sections collapsible
    - Highlight the active section in Navbar
    - Hide navigation bar while not scrolling

The Reference sources were added in the JavaScript comments.
